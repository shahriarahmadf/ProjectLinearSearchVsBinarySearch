# ProjectLinearSearchVsBinarySearch
This program takes a lower value, upper value, and interval between each element for a sorted list of numbers. Then you enter your guess and the program finds out that number using linear search algorithm and binary search algorithm. The result basically shows you the comparison between the two algorithms and their time complexity.
